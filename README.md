# Personal portfolio

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Florida with a minor in Digital Arts & Sciences, focused on building interactive, accessible web applications.

I love turning complex data and workflows into clean, intuitive interfaces, especially with React, TypeScript, and modern web tooling. Recent projects include a Pokémon-themed guessing game, a flight-tracking dashboard, and a community-volunteering platform.

I'm actively pursuing software engineering roles and internships where I can contribute as a frontend-leaning full-stack engineer, collaborate with thoughtful teams, and keep growing as a builder.
